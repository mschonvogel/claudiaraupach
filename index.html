      This is not an outdated early 90s website nor a contemporary art project. This is the humble portfolio website of
      Claudia Raupach. A Berlin-based digital communication strategist, editor, social media manager and digital consultant. 
      <a href="https://media3.giphy.com/media/vFKqnCdLPNOKc/giphy.gif" target="_blank">Hi</a>! Thanks for passing by! You must know Claudia in person? If not,
      an even warmer <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/zthJViY229AMU/giphy.gif" target="_blank">welcome</a> to you! Starting to get in
      the mood of this website? Great! So let’s get back to business. Claudia has working experience in creative concept and
      strategy, content, editorial, communication services and social media. She has been working with creative agencies such as
      <a href="https://www.kooperative-berlin.de/" target="_blank">Kooperative Berlin</a>, clients in the art scene, like <a href="https://www.berlinartweek.de/de/berlin-art-week/" target="_blank">Berlin Art Week</a>, <a href="https://performingarts-festival.de/de/performing-arts-festival-berlin" target="_blank">Performing Art Festival Berlin</a> and
      <a href="https://urban-nation.com/de/" target="_blank">Urban Nation Museum Berlin</a>, political players and NGOs. She also works with publishers, magazines and blogs. Still
      reading? High Five! Beginning to l.o.v.e this wasteland of text? Well, <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/26FLdmIp6wJr91JAI/giphy.gif" target="_blank">Claudia loves you back</a>. 
      Here is her number: <a href="tel:00491636240601">0049 163 62406 01</a>. Just give her a call right
      away or drop her an email at <a href="mailto:raupachclaudia@gmail.com">raupachclaudia@gmail.com</a>. Claudia could help you out with heaps of stuff i.e. develop
      and implement your digital communication strategy (G/E), create creative online and social media content (G/E).
      Especially during depressive autumn and winter times does she love to write (G). So get in touch if you need creative
      text support, articles or press texts. Wanna meet her for a strong, dark coffee with a sip of milk and half a spoon of
      sugar? Go on then. Send that little greeting that’s on the tip of your tongue. She isn’t as <a href="http://giphygifs.s3.amazonaws.com/media/9MFsKQ8A6HCN2/giphy.gif" target="_blank">busy</a> as this website might
      make you think. Find her also on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/c.1.c.2.c.3" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/craupach" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/claudia-raupach/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.
